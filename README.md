# Decentralized Prediction Market

This project is a decentralized prediction market built on the Stacks blockchain. It allows users to create events, place bets on different outcomes, close events, and settle bets, all in a trustless and transparent manner.

## Features

- **Create Events**: Authorized users can create new prediction events with a description and multiple outcome options.
- **Place Bets**: Users can place bets on open events by selecting an outcome and specifying the amount to bet.
- **Close Events**: The contract owner can close an event and declare the winning outcome.
- **Settle Bets**: Once an event is closed, the contract owner can settle bets, distributing payouts to users who bet on the correct outcome.

## Technology Stack

- **Clarity**: Smart contract language used to write the decentralized prediction market contract.
- **Stacks.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with the Stacks blockchain.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic web technologies for the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the interaction between the UI and the smart contract.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
- A [Stacks Wallet](https://www.hiro.so/wallet) for interacting with the Stacks blockchain.
- Familiarity with Clarity smart contracts and the Stacks ecosystem.

3. **Deploy the Smart Contract:**

   - Use the Stacks CLI or an IDE like [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) to deploy the Clarity smart contract to the Stacks blockchain.
   - Update the contract address and name in `app.js` accordingly.

4. **Run the Project:**
